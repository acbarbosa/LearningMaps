*** CIDER
CIDER is the Clojure(Script) Interactive Development Environment that Rocks!
CIDER extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Clojure. The features are centered around /cider-mode/. While /clojure-mode/ supports editing Clojure source files, /cider-mode/ adds support for *interacting with a running Clojure process for compilation, debugging, definition and documentation lookup, running tests and so on*.
CIDER's built on top of nREPL, the Clojure networked REPL.
